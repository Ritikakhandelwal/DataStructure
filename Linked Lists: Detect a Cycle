A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list.
Complete the function has_cycle in the editor below. It must return a boolean true if the graph contains a cycle, or false.

has_cycle has the following parameter(s):

Head: a pointer to a Node object that points to the head of a linked list.
Note: If the list is empty,Head  will be null.A Node is defined as: 
    class Node {
        int data;
        Node next;
    }
*/

boolean hasCycle(Node head) {
    HashSet<Node> seen = new HashSet<Node>();

  Node current = head;
    while (current != null && current.next != null) {
        if (seen.contains(current)) {
            return true;
        }

        seen.add(current);
        current = current.next;
    }

    return false;
    

}
